# Nesting Resource APIs

Nesting hierarchical resources in a REST API is a common practice. Flask-Muck provides out-of-the-box support for 
generating nested APIs if the SqlAlchemy models are related by a basic foreign key relationship. Nested APIs automatically
handle filtering child resources and  supplying the parent id as input during the Create operation.

Creating the nested relationship is as simple as setting the `parent` class variable of a FlaskMuckApiView to another 
FlaskMuckApiView who's `Model` has a valid foreign key relationship. 

```python
from flask import Blueprint

from flask_muck import FlaskMuckApiView
from myapp import db
from myapp.models import Parent, Child
from myapp.schemas import ParentSchema, ChildSchema

class ParentApiView(FlaskMuckApiView):
    api_name = "parents"
    session = db.session
    Model = Parent
    ResponseSchema = ParentSchema
    CreateSchema = Parentchema
    PatchSchema = Parentchema
    UpdateSchema = ParentSchema
    
class ChildApiView(FlaskMuckApiView):
    api_name = "children"
    session = db.session
    parent = ParentApiView#(1)!
    Model = Child#(2)!
    ResponseSchema = ChildSchema
    CreateSchema = ChildSchema
    PatchSchema = ChildSchema
    UpdateSchema = ChildSchema

blueprint = Blueprint("api", __name__, url_prefix="/api/")
ParentApiView.add_rules_to_blueprint(blueprint)
ChildApiView.add_rules_to_blueprint(blueprint)
```

1. Setting the `parent` class variable to another FlaskMuckApiView is all that is needed to set up nesting.
2. The `Child` model must have a foreign key column that references the `Parent` model.

This produces the following nested api resources.

| URL Path                           | Method | Description                               |
|------------------------------------|--------|-------------------------------------------|
| /api/parents/                      | GET    | List all parents                          |
| /api/parents/                      | POST   | Create a parent                           |
| /api/parents/<ID\>/                | GET    | Fetch a parent                            |
| /api/parents/<ID\>/                | PUT    | Update a parent                           |
| /api/parents/<ID\>/                | PATCH  | Patch a parent                            |
| /api/parents/<ID\>/                | DELETE | Delete a parent                           |
| /api/parents/<ID\>/children/       | GET    | List all of a parent's children           |
| /api/parents/<ID\>/children/       | POST   | Create a child foreign keyed to a parent. |
| /api/parents/<ID\>/children/<ID\>/ | GET    | Fetch a child                             |
| /api/parents/<ID\>/children/<ID\>/ | PUT    | Update a child                            |
| /api/parents/<ID\>/children/<ID\>/ | PATCH  | Patch a child                             |
| /api/parents/<ID\>/children/<ID\>/ | DELETE | Delete a child                            |

!!! Tip
    Nesting APIs works recursively so you don't have to stop at one level of nesting. 

!!! Warning
    If your models are not using standard integer or UUID primary keys nested APIs may not work correctly.


## Complete Example
!!! note
    This example expands on the example in the [quickstart](quickstart.md). If you have not read through the
    [quickstart](quickstart.md) this will make more sense if you do.

Let's say that we wanted to add a nested endpoint to our teacher detail endpoint from the quickstart that would allow us
to work with all of a teacher's students.

Below are the models, schemas and views we would need.

```python title="myapp/models.py"
from myapp import db

class Teacher(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String, nullable=False)
    years_teaching = db.Column(db.Integer)
    
class Student(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String, nullable=False)
    parent_id = db.Column(db.ForeignKey(Teacher.id))
    parent = db.relationship(Teacher)
```

```python title="myapp/schemas.py"
from marshmallow import Schema
from marshmallow import fields as mf


class TeacherSchema(Schema):
    id = mf.Integer(dump_only=True)
    name = mf.String(required=True)
    years_teaching = mf.Integer()

class StudentSchema(Schema):
    id = mf.Integer(dump_only=True)
    name = mf.String(required=True)
```

```python title="myapp/views.py"
from flask_muck import FlaskMuckApiView
from myapp import db
from myapp.auth.decorators import login_required
from myapp.models import Teacher, Student
from myapp.schemas import TeacherSchema, StudentSchema


class BaseApiView(FlaskMuckApiView):
    session = db.session
    decorators = [login_required]
    
    
class TeacherApiView(BaseApiView):
    api_name = "teachers" 
    Model = Teacher 
    ResponseSchema = TeacherSchema 
    CreateSchema = TeacherSchema 
    PatchSchema = TeacherSchema 
    UpdateSchema = TeacherSchema 
    searchable_columns = [Teacher.name] 

    
class StudentApiView(BaseApiView):
    api_name = "student" 
    Model = Student 
    parent = TeacherApiView
    ResponseSchema = StudentSchema 
    CreateSchema = StudentSchema 
    PatchSchema = StudentSchema 
    UpdateSchema = StudentSchema 
    searchable_columns = [Student.name]
```
