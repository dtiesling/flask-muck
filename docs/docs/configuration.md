# Configuration

Configuration in Flask-Muck is handled entirely through setting class variables on `FlaskMuckApiView`. As noted in the [quickstart](quickstart.md), you will likely have some class variable settings that are shared by most or all of your view classes. It's advisable to set up base classes to handle sharing configuration between views.

## FlaskMuckApiView Class Variables

## Base Class Example

Suppose you have an API with the following requirements for all views:

- Authentication decorator.
- Permission checking decorator.
- No allowance for patches.
- Uses "|" as the operator separator for filters.
- Uses the standard database session.

The best way to handle this is to create a base API view that all other API views inherit from.

```python title="Base Class"
class BaseApiView(FlaskMuckApiView):
    session = db.session
    decorators = [login_required, permission_required]
    allowed_methods = {"GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE"}
    operator_separator = "|"
```

```python title="Concrete Class"
class TurtleApiView(BaseApiView):#(1)!
    api_name = 'turtles'
    Model = Turtle
    ...#(2)!
```

1. The concrete view inherits from BaseApiView and all of its configurations.
2. The remainder of the class variables are configured as normal.
