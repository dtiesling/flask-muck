With Flask-Muck you don't have to worry about the CRUD.

Flask-Muck is a batteries-included framework for automatically generating RESTful APIs with Create, Read, 
Update and Delete (CRUD) endpoints in a Flask/SqlAlchemy application stack. 

## Features
- Automatic generation of CRUD endpoints.
- Built-in search, filter, sort and pagination when listing resources.
- Support for APIs with nested resources (i.e. /api/class/<ID>/students).
- Fully compatible with any other Flask method-based or class-based views. Mix & match with your existing views.
- Pre and post callbacks configurable on all manipulation endpoints that allow for arbitrary logic before and after Create, Update or Delete operations.
